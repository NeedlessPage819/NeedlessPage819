# hey i'm needlesspage819

former aimbot architect turned rocket league tool builder. mostly here because sleep is optional and python makes bad decisions easier to implement.

## what i'm doing
- **vutrium** - rocket league tool that definitely works (most of the time)
  - join if you want: https://dsc.gg/vutrium
  - will it break? probably. am i gonna fix it? eventually.
- **astralock** - ai aimbot project (retired, undefeated, never coming back)
  - learned more about opencv than any person should
  - also learned that cheat detection is very real

## tech stack (aka my comfort zone)
- python (the duct tape of programming languages)
- c++ (when python is too slow and i hate myself)
- linux (because windows updates have betrayed me one too many times)

## current status
- debugging stuff that worked yesterday
- refactoring code i wrote at 3am
- questioning life choices but committing anyway

## find me
discord: `.needlesspage819`  
status: probably fighting with an api somewhere
