# hey i'm needlesspage819

former aimbot architect turned serial rocket league tool abandoner. mostly here because sleep is optional and python makes bad decisions easier to implement.

## what i've done (graveyard edition)
- **riftbot** - current rocket league bot project (actually maintained)
  - join: discord.gg/riftbot
  - this one's different i swear
- **vutrium** - rocket league tool (discontinued)
  - rip to a real one
  - lived fast, died young, left behind spaghetti code
- **astralock** - ai aimbot project (retired, undefeated, never coming back)
  - learned more about opencv than any person should
  - also learned that cheat detection is very real

## tech stack (aka my comfort zone)
- python (the duct tape of programming languages)
- c++ (when python is too slow and i hate myself)
- linux (because windows updates have betrayed me one too many times)

## current status
- actually working on riftbot (for now)
- debugging stuff that worked yesterday
- refactoring code i wrote at 3am
- questioning life choices but committing anyway

## find me
discord: `needlesspage819`  
status: probably fighting with an api somewhere
